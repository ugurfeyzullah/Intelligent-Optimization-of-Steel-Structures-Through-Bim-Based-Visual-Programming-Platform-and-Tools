# Intelligent Optimization of Steel Structures

This repository hosts the implementation of an innovative methodology for the intelligent optimization of steel structures using a BIM-based visual programming platform and tools, as detailed in the Master Thesis by Feyzullah YAVAN at Karadeniz Technical University. The methodology leverages Genetic Algorithms (GA), Visual Programming (VP) with Dynamo, and FEA with RSA to minimize structural weight while satisfying stress and displacement constraints.

## Features

- **Integration with BIM Tools**: Utilizes Dynamo for visual programming and Revit for BIM to streamline the structural design and optimization process.
- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Employs genetic algorithms for efficient search and optimization of structural parameters.
- **Finite Element Analysis**: Uses Robot Structural Analysis (RSA) for accurate stress and displacement calculations.
- **Visual Programming**: Leverages the power of Dynamo to facilitate the parametric modeling and optimization process.
- **Life Cycle Assessment and Cost Analysis**: Incorporates LCA and cost analysis via Revit and Tally to evaluate the environmental and economic impact of optimized designs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Autodesk Revit
- Dynamo for Revit
- Robot Structural Analysis Professional
- Basic knowledge of structural engineering and optimization

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required software installed (Revit, Dynamo, RSA).
3. Open the provided Dynamo scripts within Revit using the Dynamo plugin.

## Usage
